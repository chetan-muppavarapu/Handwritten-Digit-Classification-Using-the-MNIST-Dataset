# Handwritten-Digit-Classification-Using-the-MNIST-Dataset
Built a CNN-based handwritten digit classifier using the MNIST dataset. Achieved high accuracy and confidence through effective preprocessing and model design. Used visual diagnostics such as mean digit images, confidence distributions, and PCA projections to interpret model behavior, strengths, and limitations.
